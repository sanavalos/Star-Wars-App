# Welcome To "STAR WARS APP"
This app is perfect for Star Wars fans or people trying to get more in depth of the franchise's lore.

## How does it work?
Once you enter the app, you will see Star Wars' planets list and a search bar that will allow you to filter by planet name (search must be specific) and if your search was unsuccesful you can clear the filter to get all the planets in screen again. <br/>
Also you can go through various pages until you find your favorite planet.<br/>
Once you pick and choose the planet, you can click `SEE RESIDENTS` button's card and it will take you to another section where the residents of which planet are listed. <br/>
Already in the residents section, you can click people's name to know more about them.<br/>
If you are done and want to go back to choose a new planet/resident, you are able to use the breadcrumbs located above the information of each section.<br/>

### Tips
You can also redirect to a planet/resident by making the search in your browser's address bar, i.e [https://star-wars-app-sanavalos.vercel.app/planet/Alderaan](https://star-wars-app-sanavalos.vercel.app/planet/Alderaan) or [https://star-wars-app-sanavalos.vercel.app/resident/Luke%20Skywalker](https://star-wars-app-sanavalos.vercel.app/resident/Luke%20Skywalker).<br />
Keep in mind it will take a solid minute to get all the data to display.
